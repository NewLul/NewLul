## Hi there üê±

I am currentrly a second year student in Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology.

Here are some projects I've implemented so far:
- [Markov interpreter](https://github.com/NewLul/markov-interpreter) - interpreter for [markov algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_algorithm) on python. Project is inspired by course of Mathematical Logic and Algorithm Theory (actualy was an additional task).
- [TCP protocol] - basic implementation of tcp-like protocol that can resist basic problems like packet losts, duplications and reorderings.
- [Automaton](https://github.com/NewLul/automaton) - implementation of basic algorithms of [automata theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automata_theory). Convert NFA to DFA. Minimize DFA. Convert NFA to regular expression. Find complement of regular language.
